 speaker hambeastly : So my GF has some ED issues and is on a good way to recovery. As part of that, she'd like to improve her running training. We're looking for an app that can track the usual metrics (pace, distance, time, heart rate, maybe GPS), but not display calorie estimates during running and on the workout summaries.

I know those estimates are incorrect anyway, and you cal always calculate them from the time anyway. But she'd really like to stay as far away from triggers as possible.

Is there such a thing? We tried several apps, but most like strava even force you to enter a weight...

We appreciate any suggestions! RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about someone else (their girlfriend).
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is likely "moderate" or "high".

 speaker hambeastly : It's really tough going into treatment, but eating disorders and/or the challenge of recovery do NOT excuse violating trust and behaving in a really hurtful way towards your partner. I think most people who struggle with EDs do things they're really not proud of and would not do if they were well. That doesn't make those things okay. Despite her tough situation, your rights as a person and as a partner are preserved. 

I agree with those who said that you may want to wait a little bit while she settles in, but you need to talk about this head-on eventually and now is a good time because she has a treatment team. When I was in hospital, many of the patients (myself included) went through intensely difficult situations in their lives unrelated to their disorders. I was grateful to have the support of professionals and sympathetic fellow patients when I was dealing with a family problem, and I think being in treatment made it easier to process and healthily cope.

I'm very sorry you had to go through this. I hope that you can find some peace of mind, however that may be. RESPONSE:              
1. The person in the text is talking about themselves (Yes).
2. The eating disorder symptoms described are severe (Scale: No symptoms - Severe symptoms).

 speaker hambeastly : Perhaps you can see if your school has any resources for people with EDs or similar issues. If it's a common problem among students, they might have some supports in place. From there, unfortunately, all you can really do is remind your friend that you care about her and encourage her to look into help. 

Being a good friend can mean a lot to someone who is struggling, even if they aren't ready to take the steps to get help. You can be a great friend by listening, showing interest in who she is as a person, and reminding her that you are ready to help however she needs. RESPONSE:              
1. Is the person in the text talking about themselves or someone else? - Yes.

 speaker hambeastly : Hey there. Just a friendly mod reminder that we discourage mentions of specific foods, especially when it comes to categorizing them as good or bad choices. Could you edit that part of your post about his food order? I don't want to remove your reply because it contains useful information.

Thanks. RESPONSE:              
1. The person in the text is talking about themselves. Yes.
2. The eating disorder symptoms are described as severe. 8/10.

 speaker hambeastly : It sounds like a difficult position to be in. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd assume that part of your agreement to live together is that you will both remain clean and stable. It sounds like his ED is connected to his substance abuse problems, so if he begins to relapse with his ED, it may compromise his ability to stay on track with his sobriety. Your own recovery is very important, so if you feel his behaviour is threatening your ability to stay healthy and comfortable, you're well within your rights to leave the situation.

That said, you clearly care about him and of course it's best to start with a supportive approach, but ONLY if you feel secure enough to do so. I agree that it's a good idea to suggest he see a professional or attend a group or something. If he does not feel comfortable having a scale in the house, don't buy one. This is a condition of his recovery and should be respected. 

It can be tough when someone is reluctant to talk. You can't force him. The best you can do is use assertive language when approaching the topic. Don't be accusatory. One of the communicative tips I learned in recovery was to structure statements like this: "When you X, I feel Y. I need Z." So you're essentially telling him how you feel when he does something (and be neutral: "When you joke about your eating disorder, I feel concerned and anxious" is cool, "When you treat me like crap I feel like screaming" is not). Then you explain what you need in order to change those unwanted feelings, for instance "I need to know that you trust me and respect our living arrangement."

If he refuses to budge or tell you what's up and what he needs from you to be well, you have to decide where your boundaries are and what you won't tolerate.

/r/iLiz has some good advice about being supportive and sympathetic. You'll notice that there are also some links on the sidebar, under "ED Information, Organizations, Help" that cover guidelines for dealing with friends who have or are recovering from eating disorders. Good luck. RESPONSE:

 speaker hambeastly : It's not nearly enough, but it's a step in the right direction for sure. I'm always shocked that even here in Canada, there are so few healthcare-covered options for treatment. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is likely around a moderate level, on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms".

 speaker hambeastly : I agree that you should talk to her without being confrontational. Express how you feel and that you're worried. I think this is better than waiting because she might never feel ready, and she might have a serious medical emergency before then. I know that I was very upset and resistant when I was first confronted with concern, because I felt embarrassed and like I was stuck--like I couldn't fix it so why ask me to? At that point, it's good to say that you think professional help is necessary and that you will be supportive throughout. There is nothing to lose by seeing a professional. The ED is always going to be an option, so it's a matter of knowing the risks of sticking with that option and realizing that treatment is a worthwhile alternative. 

This may not be a popular opinion, but I think I was greatly affected by hearing how people close to me feel. Hearing that they did not want to live without me, but that they couldn't live with someone who was actively sick. Even though it was painful and I was reluctant to listen at first, it did get through to me. This is your partner, and you are talking about long-term plans. It is fair for you to expect her to be open about important things that could affect those plans. It is fair for her to let you know if she is struggling with an ED and whether she is working on it.

When I was struggling with bulimic episodes, there were a lot of things I needed. At first, I didn't know how to articulate a lot of that. I knew when I felt uncomfortable, but it was only through treatment that I was able to understand what I need to get better and how to ask for that. So asking her to tell you what she needs may not get you much right now. But it's important for her to feel like she has an ally and is not alone. In the thick of an eating disorder, feeling alone is very dangerous because often people with EDs don't care too much about themselves and can't find much motivation to get better without support.

Finally, in response to your question about what could lead to this. I see it as follows: there's often a perfect storm that can create an ED. It varies a lot, and the ED that results can vary too. All forms of ED are usually caused by a complicated combination of internal and external factors. Commonly, a person with an ED has a perfectionistic personality, a predisposition towards unhealthy coping mechanisms, and a history that might include anxiety or depression. Often there is a genetic history of addiction or mental illness. This is exacerbated by outside factors like pressure to succeed, troubled relationships with family or SOs, being in a high-pressure performance environment like athletics or modeling, and/or emotional/sexual/physical abuse and trauma. It's very different for every person, but each of those factors is correlated (but not necessarily causative). 

I hope some of this helps, and I can only offer experience as someone who has struggled with a binge/purge ED, not as a partner. I also want to say that if you are open to seeking counseling, I think that's a great idea. A counselor likely has experience helping people with EDs and can give you advice based on that experience. They can also be there if you need to vent your feelings and worries. When I was in treatment the head psychiatrist strongly encouraged that we make therapy appointments with our loved ones to help them understand and to communicate in a mediated environment. It was very helpful for me. RESPONSE:

 speaker hambeastly : The fact that you posted this tells me that something is causing you a lot of stress and pain. That's not cool. It sounds like you have a really hard time accepting yourself and just relaxing and letting your body be. And it sounds like that stress is causing ADDITIONAL worry. That's no way to live!

If you ask me, I think you should get help and I am certain that you deserve it. You're unhappy with yourself. That's what therapy is for! No matter what comes of it, you will learn something and it will almost certainly help. If you let it linger, it could get far worse and I don't think it's worth risking that. It is possible to feel comfortable with your body and to not care about the scale or how your stomach looks in various poses. You deserve that. RESPONSE:

 speaker hambeastly : It took over a year, but my hair is thick as it was before (and it is THICK).  I found that the first few months of recovery actually saw me losing more hair. I asked my doctor, who said that because hair grows so slowly and goes through long cycles, you can actually see the nutritional effects months later. So if you're worried that your hair is not repairing very quickly, remember that it takes a lot of time.  RESPONSE:              
1. Yes.
2. Moderate symptoms. 
--------

 speaker hambeastly : It's very likely that this problem is tied to your ED, and because of this you will only really see improvement if you get help for your ED and stop purging. 

In the meantime, you should see a doctor and ask about your options. Purging can cause permanent complications if it is untreated. It can take some time to reverse problems like involuntary vomiting/acid reflux, but the sooner you seek help, the more likely you are to make a full recovery. RESPONSE:

 speaker hambeastly : It is okay if you think there's too much going on and you can't be in a healthy relationship. I avoided serious relationships until I was pretty sure I had things under control. Your health is most important.

When I started dating, I was honest about the fact that I had recently left treatment and was still trying to get the hang of this normal eating, healthy body image stuff. It was very helpful for me, because I was starting to understand what I needed to be healthy and I could ask for help with specific challenges, so he didn't feel like I had just dropped a bomb and he was totally helpless. I tried to be constructive and optimistic about it, like "Hey, I'm still in a rough part of my life but here's all the ways you can help me kick ass." There are so many benefits of sharing your ED story. It means that you don't feel like you're keeping a huge secret, you don't risk being found out in some dramatic episode down the road, your partner sees that you trust him, everything is on the table, and you have a support who knows what's up and can help you. 

I slipped up a few times in the early months. I didn't lie about it. It was terrifying and I thought he would leave me, but he stuck it out. He talked to my mother, with my permission. He read up on being a partner to someone recovering from an ED. He was very supportive and encouraging, and I am glad I took the risk and just let him know. I think if I had experienced those slip-ups silently, it could have spiraled into something worse.

If you plan on recovering it is pretty much essential to be open about this stuff. If you are not sure about recovery right now, it's worth considering whether this is a good time to be in a relationship and whether you're able to be the kind of partner you want to be while you're sick. RESPONSE:              
Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.

On a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms," I would rate the eating disorder symptoms described as "moderate." The person mentions having recently left treatment and still trying to get the hang of normal eating and healthy body image, which suggests they are still struggling with these issues. However, they also mention being honest with their partner about their struggles and seeking support, which indicates a level of self-awareness and proactivity in managing their condition.

 speaker hambeastly : Disclaimer: This is only based on personal experience, the advice I received from my treatment team, and the observations I made of others. Remember that you should see a professional who is aware of your ED and full medical history rather than just take internet advice at face value.

I believe that full recovery, for most people (especially those with restrictive EDs and/or exercise addiction, but pretty much everyone) depends on an uncomfortably long period of time with little to no deliberate exercise. If you are medically stable and not severely underweight, it's usually okay to walk reasonable distances and go about your daily life and participate in recreational activities with friends. A lot of people enjoy yoga early in recovery. But if you feel the need to exercise in part because you feel uncomfortable with how much you're eating, or the weight you've gained, you probably need to wait until you've been stable for a bit. The fact that you are still feeling strong temptation to go back to calorie counting and similar behaviour is a big red flag. Going back into an intense fitness mindset/environment too soon is a pretty easy way to relapse. I've personally never seen it work out. And I would really hate to see you fall back after coming so far.

Recovery means learning how to feel discomfort and live with it. Sometimes that discomfort is extreme. It will get easier, and you will learn to rediscover physical activity in a way that is fun and rewarding. You may have to give up certain things forever. I don't think I will ever go back to calorie-counting machines at the gym.  I had to throw out clothes I LOVED and spent a lot of money on because they don't fit my healthy body, and having them around was triggering. I don't think I'll ever own a scale again. And I miss all that stuff sometimes. But it's worth trading it in for the freedom of not having an ED. RESPONSE:

 speaker hambeastly : In my experience, my partner was more worried about coming across as too controlling. And I made it clear that the best thing he could do for me was model healthy behaviour, treat me like a normal person and not a weirdo, and help me when I ask for help. Giving specific advice reduces the risk of him just impulsively trying to take over and protect you. And if it does happen, you can remind him that you are an adult. You can also help discourage unhelpful "help" by seeing a professional and reminding him that they are more experienced with this kind of thing, so you'll follow their lead and ask for his support when it's needed. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about someone else (their partner).
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is moderate to severe.

 speaker hambeastly : Make sure you are getting enough of all the nutrients you need, and enough water. If you haven't recently, it'd be good to have a blood test done to make sure your vitamins and minerals are all good. 

It took a few months for my face to catch up to my body, I'd say, but I am also getting older (25 now) and your face shape can change with age. I find that my face is thinner now than it was before my ED at the same weight, and that some features have gotten more prominent. That's just normal aging.

Beyond that, take good care of your skin. Moisturize and use SPF. Avoid heavy drinking, drugs, and smoking if applicable. Those can all damage your skin's elasticity and your complexion quicker than aging alone.

Congratulations on your recovery and I hope you're doing well. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is moderate to severe. 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : You should see a medical doctor or a psychologist/psychiatrist. They can see if you meet the criteria for a diagnosis. It sounds like you have some serious struggles going on, and I truly believe you need professional help beyond what your social worker can offer.

When I was in treatment there were many people at "normal" weights. That's not to say it was their natural, healthy weight, but it is not unusual to be very sick without being underweight. Treatment professionals are not trying to make you gain an unhealthy amount of weight. They are trying to help you overcome your dangerous and disordered behaviour. They will not make you eat more than you need to. It was common in treatment to adjust patients' meal plans to fit their needs. 

That said, it's still important to challenge fear foods. I eat all the foods I was once afraid of now, and I am still at my personal healthy weight because I am eating what I need overall. The thing about eating more anxiety-provoking foods in recovery is that it helps you learn to deal with normal situations, like birthday parties, vacations or going out for dinner. It's normal to eat differently in these situations. If you have developed the coping skills to enjoy special occasions without resorting to unhealthy behaviours, you will not lose control of your eating. If you do not have the coping skills, you might be paralysed by fear or overcome by panic. That's not healthy, and that's why it's important to become comfortable with a wide variety of foods. It doesn't mean you have to eat them all the time forever. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.

 speaker hambeastly : You can absolutely have an eating disorder when you are overweight. You can have an eating disorder at any weight. Throwing up on purpose is not normal or just part of a temporary, relatively harmless "diet." It's a sign of a serious problem. I would say that the difference between an eating disorder and dieting is how you feel about yourself and how much your life is impacted. How much do you think about it? Are you unhappy because you are so fixated on food? Do your friends and family ask what's wrong because they can tell you're struggling? Do you withdraw or behave drastically because you don't like how you look? Do you find yourself being secretive about your eating, either lying about what you ate or eating privately out of shame/self-consciousness?

I would seriously consider talking to a doctor and/or dietitian. It is okay to lose weight if your doctor says it's okay, but it's important to do it carefully and keep a close eye on your mental health. Because you are struggling with a lot right now, it might be a good time to just focus on treating what's already going on. If you find it hard to let go of the weight loss obsession, it's time to see a professional right away. 

This is very similar to how my ED started. I was depressed, anxious, somewhat overweight, dealing with difficult curveballs in life and just thought losing weight would make me happier. It got out of control so fast, and I had no idea. Don't be blindsided. You don't want to waste years on this. RESPONSE:              
Sure! Here are my answers to your questions:

1. The person in the text is talking about themselves. (Yes)
2. The eating disorder symptoms described are severe. (Scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms": 8/10) 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : I've been recovered from anorexia/bulimia/laxative abuse for three years as well, and fortunately I seem to have avoided most of the long-lasting side effects. I'm hoping it's the same for you. If you see a doctor at your university's health centre, it's a good idea to mention your history just so they know. They'll probably ask if you have any medical issues in your past anyway, and anorexia counts. 

As has been said, bone density loss is a biggie. I have never had a bone scan and my doctor said that since I don't show any problems, it's not necessary, but frankly I would not be surprised if my bone density is a bit iffy. Eating disorders can also cause long-term digestive issues, and vitamin/nutrient deficiencies can go unresolved for a long time if you don't know they exist and thus aren't eating enough of the foods you need to replenish those levels. 

You can have ongoing heart problems. If you feel like your heartbeat is irregular or if you have chest pain, that needs to be checked out.

Infertility is another possibility. It's not something you usually find out unless you are trying to conceive. My doctors (and medical studies) said that if your period returns in recovery, and if you maintain recovery, you're probably at about the same risk level as someone without a history of anorexia, so that's good news.

Prolonged malnutrition and starvation can lead to temporary or permanent cognitive impairment, like memory loss or inability to concentrate.

And on the mental health side of things, anorexia can often be accompanied by mood disorders and substance abuse. These can start before, during, or after your eating disorder and can continue for long after and even result in death. Be aware of your emotional and mental health. It's okay to seek help, even if you feel like you're supposed to be okay now. Don't let things fester.

Most serious complications are ones that you would know about by now if you had them. The best thing you can do is to continue being healthy because that's the only way to maintain a low risk of complications. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is "moderate" on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms". 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : I'd also recommend the exchange system. It's what they used in my treatment program and it was something that is pretty easy to master with a little practice, so I could continue defaulting to it when I left treatment and was still a little shaky on meal planning/uncomfortable reading nutrition labels. You can find exchange-based meal plans online that correspond to different calorie levels. 

It's definitely not okay or fun to refuse to eat things if you don't know their caloric value. It's a really sticky situation that limits you and makes you feel miserable. It's so freeing to just be able to choose what you want, estimate the portions to fulfill your exchange needs, and enjoy. It's even better when you don't even need to think about exchanges anymore because balance becomes intuitive.

If you have a professional supporting your treatment, ask them about this. If that legitimately isn't an option, I'd try looking up an exchange meal plan, thinking of some common foods you like that could function for each exchange type and make a grocery list. Then you can put together meals using a variety of ingredients based on what you feel like eating. It might help you feel more comfortable to know that you are getting what you need without having to track every number, and it allows for flexibility so you can work towards enjoying food again. 

You don't need to have eating down to a perfect science--in fact, that can be really unpleasant for most people. It's best to have a rough idea and do your best to honour both your body's needs and your wants. RESPONSE:              
Of course! Here are my answers to your questions:

1. Is the person in the text talking about themselves or someone else?
Yes, the person is talking about themselves.
2. How severe are the eating disorder symptoms described on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms"?
The symptoms are described as "mild" or "moderate", rather than "severe". 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : I think EDs are the result of a "perfect storm." The elements involved in that storm might be different for everyone, but I believe that it breaks down into 1) predisposition, like family history of mental health/addiction issues, personality traits, mood disorders, and 2) environment, like high-pressure education or jobs or athletic pursuits, abuse and other traumatic life events, cultural pressures, relationships.

So there's some element of chance, some element of predestination. It's not about wanting it and it's not about being weak. It's a result of the flip of a thousand coins.

I know you feel like you've exhausted all your options, but sometimes you need to try again. And again. And again. Because it's not going to work until it really clicks for you, and that doesn't always happen the first time. I went to the exact same hospital and saw the exact same doctors in treatment twice, after seeing more therapists than I can count. One time I relapsed right away. The second time, for some reason, because of some decisions I made and some breakthroughs I finally had... it actually stuck. I met people for whom it took 4, 6, 8 runs through treatment for it to work. If you don't want to spend your life on bulimia, spend it on tirelessly pursuing recovery. RESPONSE:              
1. The person in the text is talking about themselves. Yes.
2. The eating disorder symptoms described are severe. Yes. 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : So many good points here! It can be very difficult to support a loved one when you can't force them to get help. But it was very encouraging, for me, to hear from people I love that they wanted to help me through recovery. It made me feel less alone and hesitant when I finally decided to get treatment. So don't think you're doing nothing by just being there. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The eating disorder symptoms described are severe, on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms".

 speaker hambeastly : I have received treatment for b/p subtype AN in Canada. There are healthcare-covered treatment options, but the spots available are woefully few and the waiting list can be long. I would recommend contacting treatment centres, explaining your situation and your location, and asking if they can help. I was treated in Ottawa and I highly recommend the program at the Ottawa General Hospital. I have no idea where you are or what your financial situation is, so the answer depends somewhat on that. Options vary from groups and outpatient programs to intensive, inpatient programs. It is better to sign up now than wait to be referred or end up in the ER when things are very critical. 

Beyond that, you have a few more options: 

1. Look at ED resources in your area. There may be a support centre with groups and/or counseling available. 
1. Look at psychologists/psychiatrists/therapists in general. There are websites (e.g. [this](http://www.nedic.ca/give-get-help/service-provider-directory) and [this](https://therapists.psychologytoday.com)) that list professionals along with their areas of expertise, which includes EDs. It's best to see someone who knows this problem well. 
1. Look at self-help options. Check out the subreddit sidebar, which has some links!

I strongly believe that it's best to go with the most intensive treatment possible, as soon as possible. And I think that while it's natural to feel hesitant about "coming out," it's not nearly as bad as you fear and it is an important, cathartic step in recovery.

If you want to, you can message me with a more specific location. I have met people from across the country in treatment and I have an okay idea of what resources exist. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is "moderate" to "severe". 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : I think that it's a great idea to seek counseling. Sometimes psychological problems can manifest in ways that seem totally physiological. It doesn't mean that they are, and in many cases therapy can even help with issues that are physical in source. Having a poor appetite because that's how your body is could be the problem, but it's not going to be made any better if you have anxiety on top of that.

I'd say that if you decide to go, make a list or write out a little blurb about your experience so that you can cover all the things that you think might come into play with this problem. You may find, after writing and sharing, that there's more going on psychologically/emotionally than you realized.

Good luck with treating your eating problems, and good luck with your efforts to conceive. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is "moderate" on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms". 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : Those behaviors could signify purging, but it could mean they just need to use the restroom after meals or want to wash their hands/face. Still, if they seem very preoccupied with food it is very possible that they have SOME form of eating disorder.

It is impossible to singlehandedly save someone from an eating disorder. Especially if you are not sure if they have EDs and just going on a hunch, confronting them will likely not really answer any questions or help anyone. But it's okay to ask "Are you all right? Lately it seems like you're having a hard time and feeling off. I care about you and I want to listen if you need to talk." RESPONSE:              
1. The person in the text is talking about someone else (Yes).
2. The eating disorder symptoms described are severe (score: 7 or higher on a scale of 1-10). 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : These are great. I'd just want to add the myth that accompanies the "Nah, she can't have an eating disorder--I've seen her eat!" statement. People with restrictive eating disorders are good at hiding them and behaving normally in front of others. People with binge-related EDs like bulimia or BED might appear to eat normally or more than average but can still have very serious, medically dangerous conditions. If you are not watching a person 24/7, you can't know for sure if they have an ED or not. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about someone else.
2. The severity of the eating disorder symptoms described is likely "severe." 
--------
--------
 speaker hambeastly : You ALWAYS have time to seek treatment for your problem. This is the number one priority for anyone with an ED. You are the only person you have. You can't risk losing you.

Nobody is going to rescue you, though. You've got to take a logical perspective and think of the pros and cons to seeking help. You've got to get on your own side and say "Yeah, I am going to work towards recovery." 

Why do you think it's not worth your time? Are there aspects of recovery that are frightening to you? How do you feel about living with your disorder? Do you think you're doing okay, or do you think you could be happier/healthier? I think it's a good time for you to be really honest with yourself and take some time to reflect on where you are now and where you want to be. EDs are very alienating and they can put a major strain on your relationships and your ability to enjoy life. It doesn't have to be like that. 

It takes some effort and some temporary sacrifice, but I really believe it is worth the time/energy investment to go on a recovery crusade and take care of this before it's too late. RESPONSE:              
1. Is the person in the text talking about themselves or someone else? - Yes.
2. How severe are the eating disorder symptoms described on a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms"? - Moderate to Severe symptoms.

 speaker hambeastly : I had a really hard time getting my digestion back on track. Like, lots of constipation, tummy aches, bloating, acid reflux. I still don't think I'm 100% like I was before, but I am pretty close.

And after eating large amounts during binges, it was hard to regain my hunger cues. It's definitely not pleasant, but it's not permanent. Over time you will be able to feel satisfied with normal meals. I found it has helped for me to really focus on eating foods that are satisfying and nourishing instead of eating low-cal or 'diet' foods for fear of "overdoing it" and eating more calories than I wanted to. Waiting for things to calm down is stressful, but eventually I started to feel my body reacting in the way a body should to adequate nutrition and normal portions.

You might gain weight. Not going to pretend otherwise. But that's really not the worst possible outcome. It'd be worse to stay sick, do permanent damage, and have your body fall apart in ways that are unfixable. Initial rapid weight gain is often temporary if you can stick to healthy behaviours long enough. You might not be at the same weight you are when you are sick, but keep in mind that bodies do some weird shit in the early stages of recovery, often longer, and it by no means determines where you'll settle after a year or two of consistency.

 speaker hambeastly : Well, I absolutely believe it's important to eliminate "fear foods" so that your relationship with food can be open and free and chill. But it's tough. It's easy to psych yourself out and worry about numbers or urges or how you fear you will appear to others if you enjoy certain foods. It doesn't have to be that way, and I'm glad to hear you have a positive attitude and a goal of being able to approach these foods with a healthy attitude.

It really helped me to reintroduce some of my more difficult foods in social settings, where I had a distraction and I had people around me to help me feel "normal." 

As has also been said, it's largely a matter practice. You have to go through the motions until you break that connection between action and internal freak-out. It helped me in this case, too, to look to others who I considered to be good eating role models--people who didn't obsess over food or "good" and "bad" choices and just ate more intuitively. I wanted so badly to be like them, so I tried to be flexible and calm like them. It helped a LOT. It took time, and a lot of really anxious moments, but it is one of those cases where "fake it 'til you make it" applies (as long as you are not faking the eating part, just the calmness part).

 speaker hambeastly : I understand why this is a struggle for you and I'm glad you want to start getting help. I'm not too familiar with this kind of ED, but I know that it is very hard to feel limited by food fears and aversions. I think it might be a good idea to research some therapists/psychologists in your area. Depending on where you live, there may be databases and sometimes those list each professional's areas of specialization. You can call around and ask potential therapists if this is something they have experience with.

As I'm sure you know, this condition is also sometimes called "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder," so that's another term you can search for. You might be able to find support groups, as well. 

I hope this helps a bit! Keep advocating for yourself and don't let professionals brush you off if they don't understand what you're struggling with. Someone out there gets it. RESPONSE:              
1. Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.

 speaker hambeastly : Nail polish was a HUGE deal when I was in IP. It was one of our major bonding activities/most valuable commodities. Magazines (nothing with diet/fitness crap in it) are great. So are fun, easy-to-read books. Colouring stuff too! And origami paper. Sudoku books and crossword puzzles... If you're allowed to bring any sort of hygiene stuff, make sure she has what she needs for cleansers, lotions, shampoo, etc.

I also played board games a lot in IP and it was awesome when someone brought a new one that we could play together, or that I could borrow for a bit. And I loved receiving cards, poems and photos from family and friends. It was always great to have stuff to put on my wall and make my half-room a little cozier and colourful. RESPONSE:              
Yes, the person in the text is talking about themselves.

On a scale of "no symptoms" to "severe symptoms," the eating disorder symptoms described are likely around a moderate level (a score of 3-4 out of 5). The text mentions the person's enjoyment of activities that do not involve diet or fitness, such as reading, coloring, and playing board games. It also mentions receiving cards, poems, and photos from family and friends, which suggests that the person is seeking comfort and support from others. These are all behaviors that can be indicative of an eating disorder, particularly in the context of an inpatient treatment program.
