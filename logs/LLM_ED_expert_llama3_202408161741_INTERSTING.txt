Text:    So my GF has some ED issues and is on a good way to recovery. As part of that, she'd like to improve her running training. We're looking for an app that can track the usual metrics (pace, distance, time, heart rate, maybe GPS), but not display calorie estimates during running and on the workout summaries.

I know those estimates are incorrect anyway, and you cal always calculate them from the time anyway. But she'd really like to stay as far away from triggers as possible.

Is there such a thing? We tried several apps, but most like strava even force you to enter a weight...

We appreciate any suggestions!
RESPONSE:               Thanks in advance!

Answer: 1) (0), 2) (3)

Text:    It's really tough going into treatment, but eating disorders and/or the challenge of recovery do NOT excuse violating trust and behaving in a really hurtful way towards your partner. I think most people who struggle with EDs do things they're really not proud of and would not do if they were well. That doesn't make those things okay. Despite her tough situation, your rights as a person and as a partner are preserved. 

I agree with those who said that you may want to wait a little bit while she settles in, but you need to talk about this head-on eventually and now is a good time because she has a treatment team. When I was in hospital, many of the patients (myself included) went through intensely difficult situations in their lives unrelated to their disorders. I was grateful to have the support of professionals and sympathetic fellow patients when I was dealing with a family problem, and I think being in treatment made it easier to process and healthily cope.

I'm very sorry you had to go through this. I hope that you can find some peace of mind, however that may be.
RESPONSE:               In the meantime, please know that EDs don't define your entire life or make you a "bad" person. We are all human beings with complicated lives and struggles, and it is important to treat each other with kindness and compassion.

Answer: 1. 0
2. 5

Text:    Perhaps you can see if your school has any resources for people with EDs or similar issues. If it's a common problem among students, they might have some supports in place. From there, unfortunately, all you can really do is remind your friend that you care about her and encourage her to look into help. 

Being a good friend can mean a lot to someone who is struggling, even if they aren't ready to take the steps to get help. You can be a great friend by listening, showing interest in who she is as a person, and reminding her that you are ready to help however she needs.
RESPONSE:               And while it might feel like there's not much you can do beyond that, sometimes just being a consistent presence in someone' life is enough to make all the difference.
I don't know if this is helpful but I have heard of people who have taken up running or other forms of physical activity as a way to help with eating disorders. It might be something for your friend to look into?
