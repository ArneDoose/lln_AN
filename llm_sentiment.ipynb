From there, you will be able to grasp how she feels about it. If she thinks it's not a big deal at all and that it isn't harmful, then there isn't too much you can do. You can suggest she go to therapy and start making strides into recovery, but a suggestion is all you can do.\n",

Just keep encouraging that she seek help.

My friend Rachel asked me to write my story so she could read it to her health class, and I decided to post it in honor of NEDAWeek. I am not ashamed of my disease, and if this note can help even one person find the courage to ask for help, then it was worth putting my past out into the Facebook world. Hopefully one day the stigma related to eating disorders will be shattered and the rest of the world will realize that it has nothing to do with weight, vanity, or food at all.\n",

      "My Story:\n",
      "\n",
      "In middle school, there was very little more that I wanted than to sit at the popular kids’ table. I never did. I was average. I played soccer and basketball, but I usually started on the bench. I was in the school plays, but I never had a lead role. I wasn’t ugly, but I wasn’t gorgeous. I wasn’t fat, but I wasn’t skinny. I wasn't stupid, but I was never the smartest in my classes. And I had 4 siblings that solidified this feeling of mediocrity. I was a Smith kid, but there was no way to define myself other than the ‘little sister.’ I wanted to fit in so much, but I also wanted to stand out. My mind was in a constant battle, my anxiety was unmanageable, and my fear of being lost in the crowd was at the front of my mind at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was in 7th grade, I watched a TV movie about eating disorders. Because it was made for TV and wasn’t a boring health video, it didn't talk about the health consequences or the nitty-gritty of the disorder. Instead, it glorified eating disorders and made it seem like something one could do for 3 months and then soon get over. It intrigued me. It was the exact thing I was looking for. I had tried other versions of self-harm, but none of those provided me the relief I craved. Nobody could see how much I was hurting, and they needed to know. So that day, at Target with my mom, I decided to refuse the smoothie she bought. I was hungry, and I wanted a sip of that smoothie so bad, but that day, I decided to change my life. That day, in that very instant, I decided that I needed to control my life, and I felt that the best way to do that was to control my eating habits. I didn’t have to give in to the hunger cues that my body was giving me; I was above that.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 9th grade, I had hit my lowest weight. My parents tried sending me to a psychologist, but I lied and said I just wasn’t hungry. I knew weight loss was a symptom of depression, so I convinced everyone that I lost my appetite because I wasn’t happy. They put me on anti-depressants and thought that would cure me. What they didn’t know was that I was starving at all times. One day at my friend’s house, I ate some trail mix. I couldn’t stop thinking about the calories in the mix, so I went upstairs and purged the food. I started purging at school, at home, and in restaurants. Fortunately, my friends recognized what was going on and decided to write a letter to my mom (who worked at my high school) and put it in her mailbox. After about a week, I got called into my assistant principal’s office and was met by my principal and parents. They had a bag packed and said I was leaving right then, in the middle of my 9th grade year, to go to inpatient treatment at an eating disorder hospital. I was angry, but I also was excited. I thought that maybe – just maybe – I would be able to find my way out of this eating disordered hell. When I got to my very first inpatient stay, I was very underweight, and my blood pressure was 76/32. I remember that number exactly because I truly believed I was going to die. Unfortunately, that wasn’t enough to scare me into helping myself. Soon into my stay, I had to sleep in front of the nurses’ station because they caught me exercising in my room. I asked one of the girls that was only there 12 hours a day to buy me diet pills and laxatives. I was still a slave to my anorexia.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am now 24. Last summer was my 8th stay in a treatment facility. Two years ago, I missed Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s, and my birthday in a 3-month residential stay. I have missed many birthdays of loved ones and family vacations, and I have missed 4 Easters. If I string together the amount of time I have spent in different treatment facilities, it totals over a year. Imagine where you were one year ago. I spent that time living away from family and friends and tackling my eating disorder. I have an arrhythmia, gastritis, acid reflux, GERD, a hernia, and osteopenia, and there is a possibility that I will never have children because I went years without my period. I wish more than anything that it didn’t take me 7 years to graduate college due to medical withdrawals for treatment. I look back on the last 11 years of my life and cannot believe I wasted all of this time, energy, and money on this disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I also know that it was not my fault. Eating disorders are not about food or weight or vanity. They are a disease that people do not ask for, and they tear apart lives. Those close to me still have to deal with my eating disorder, but they do not have to worry that I will keel over and die anymore. As of last Fall, I can honestly say that I am in recovery. I am not working towards recovery, and recovery is not an abstract thought. Just last summer, I was at a residential facility in North Carolina bawling and hyperventilating because the chef poured olive oil in the rice; now I can eat hummus (with olive oil!). I have maintained a healthy body weight for longer than any other time post-treatment. I can order French fries. I ate a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese icing a few months ago and ate banana cake on my birthday -- and I kept both down. I am in the process of reversing most of the health consequences from 11 years of torturing my body, but there are some that cannot be reversed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing in this world that I wish I could change more than the decision to not drink that smoothie at Target. I still struggle and have daily battles in my mind, but they are getting less prominent. There are some days that I struggle and give in to my eating disorder, but instead of treating that as an excuse to spiral, I can overcome those mini-battles and continue to take more steps forward than back. However, I never would be where I am today if I didn’t receive help. My friends took a huge leap by writing that letter to my parents when I was in 9th grade, but they don’t realize that they saved my life. I would not have stopped until I was dead. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. In fact, 20% of people suffering from anorexia will die from complications related to their eating disorder, and these deaths can come well after somebody has entered recovery. Eating disorders are an addiction, a compulsion, an obsession, and a slow (or sometimes quick) suicide. They are not a diet or a joke, and they will ruin your life. I was lucky to make it out alive, but I know many people who have died at the hand of their eating disorder. It is not something to be ashamed of – getting help shows true strength. More people are struggling than you realize, and you are not alone. An eating disorder does not mean you are broken, crazy, or weak. It means you have a disease you did not ask for, and suffering in silence is not necessary.\n",
